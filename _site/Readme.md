About
===

This is my [blog](http://ulizko.com/) source. It contains blog posts (in the [_posts](https://github.com/aulizko/blog/tree/master/_posts) directory), examples (in the [demo](https://github.com/aulizko/blog/tree/master/demo) directory) and some files and directories required for backward compatibility (like wp-content, where some external resources are linked to).

This blog source is designed to work with [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) static site generator.

To put it simple, jekyll converts markdown-based posts inside the _posts directory into static html pages which can be easily processed by nginx (or any other server).

Why?
===

Why do I keep the blog source on github? Well, first of all I’m tired of continual questions like “where can I get the source code of your examples?”. You can find it in the [demo](https://github.com/aulizko/blog/tree/master/demo) directory.

Secondly, I’m not good at blogging and all those literacy- and grammar-related things, so I suppose there are many mistakes in my posts. Perhaps somebody (or even you?) could help me and provide me with some fixes.

Remember, you can find any post source inside [_posts](https://github.com/aulizko/blog/tree/master/_posts) directory.
