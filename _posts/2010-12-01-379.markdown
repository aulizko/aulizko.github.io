title: "Quick tip for Intellij Idea users: manage your dependencies order"

Recently I was developing project on top of Servlet API 3.0 and GWT 2.1 and faced the following problem:
When I wanted to use async support from Servlet 3.0, [Idea](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) was unable to resolve method startAsync for HttpServletRequest.

Like this:

<img title="Resolving method failure" src="/images/idea_dependencies/resolving_method_failure.png" alt="Resolving method failure" width="344" height="31" />

It turns out that gwt-dev-2.1.0.jar contains Servlet API 2.4 (looks like it comes with jetty or tomcat gwt dependencies) and [Idea](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) uses it for inspections and autocomplete.

Solution is simple:
Check if servlet api 3.0 jar comes after gwt-dev-2.1.0.jar in yout project module dependencies (meta+; shortcut), like this:

<img title="Wrong dependency order" src="/images/idea_dependencies/wrong_dependency_order.png" alt="Wrong dependency order" width="481" height="34" />

And swap them using "Move Up"|"Move Down" keys, than hit OK button.
After that Idea will resolve Servlet API as expected:
